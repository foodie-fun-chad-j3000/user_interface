# Foodie Fun
A web app that tracks menu items at your favorite restaurant. Never eat the same thing twice! Keep track of what you ate, how much you liked it and what kind of dish it was. Search for a dish or restaruant you ate at to quickly check what you've already eaten and what you've yet to try.
